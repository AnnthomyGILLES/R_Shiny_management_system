# Consultant File Management System

## Project Overview

### Context
Traditionally, the process of managing consultant files involved recurring physical meetings among three key parties: the client, the consultant, and the manager. This approach required an extensive exchange of emails for updates, making the process cumbersome and time-consuming. To streamline and secure this process, especially concerning the exchange of confidential information, I have developed a fully digitalized consultant file management system.

### Solution
This web-based solution facilitates the creation, update, and tracking of consultant files in a secure, digital environment. The system simplifies the collaboration process among clients, consultants, and managers, ensuring efficient and secure information exchange.

## Features

1. **Account Creation and Authentication System**: 
   - Implemented using Firebase, offering a secure and reliable way for users to create accounts and log in to the system.

2. **Web Application Development**:
   - Developed using R (Shiny), Javascript, and CSS, providing a robust and user-friendly interface for interaction with the system.

3. **Dashboard**:
   - A comprehensive dashboard for an overview of consultant files, including status updates, user activity, and other relevant data.

4. **NoSQL Database Integration**:
   - Utilized MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval, offering scalability and flexibility in handling large volumes of data.

5. **Dynamic Permission and User Rights Management**:
   - System dynamically manages user permissions and rights, ensuring secure access to sensitive data based on user roles.

## Key Technologies
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: For hosting and managing application resources in the cloud.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application, ensuring consistency across various development and production environments.
- **Firebase**: For authentication and account management.
- **R, Javascript, and CSS**: Primary languages used for developing the web application.
- **MongoDB**: As the NoSQL database for data storage.
- **Git**: For version control and collaborative development.
- **HTML and CSS**: For structuring and styling the web interface.
